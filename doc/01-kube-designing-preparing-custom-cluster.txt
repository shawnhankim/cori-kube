Creating a Custom Cluster from Scratch
(Designing and Preparing)
=======================================

- Cloud Provider

- Nodes

- Network
  * Network Connectivity
  * Network Policy

- Cluster Naming

- Software Binaries
  * Downloading and Extracting Kubernetes Binaries
  * Selecting Images

- Security Models
  * Preparing Certs
  * Preparing Credentials
  
- Notes.
  * Apiserver and etcd together are fine on a machine with 1 core and 1GB RAM for clusters with 10s of nodes. Larger or more active clusters may benefit from more cores
    - [Question] How many API servers are recommended with 100s nodes
  * Classiess Inter-Domain Routing(CIDR) : Subnet Range
    - /24 per node supports 254 pods per machine
    - 10.10.0.0/16 as the range for the cluster, with up to 256 nodes using 10.10.0.0/24 through 10.10.255.0/24
